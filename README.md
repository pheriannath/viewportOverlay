# viewportOverlay
Simple JS module to add an overlay that displays relevant viewport/device properties.

# Usage
Install the module however you choose, and make sure the CSS file is included. You'll also want to make sure your [viewport meta tags](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/responsive-meta-tag/) are set up properly.

Initialize the module:

`viewport_overlay.init()`

Resizing your browser window, changing orientation, etc. will trigger the overlay to update. Use the numbers to assist in generating media queries, to measure viewports of strange and unfamiliar devices, or to take over the world.
